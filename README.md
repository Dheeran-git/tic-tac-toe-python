# Tic Tac Toe - Python Milestone Project

This is a fully interactive, console-based Tic Tac Toe game written in Python.  
It was developed as the **first milestone project for ["Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python"](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) by [Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/user/joseportilla/)**.  
The code is based on the project walkthrough notebook provided by the course, but all logic and integration were implemented and tested step by step by me, as part of my learning journey.

## Features

- **Two-player console game** — each player selects a marker ('X' or 'O') and takes alternate turns.
- **Input validation** — ensures players choose valid markers, positions, and do not overwrite existing squares.
- **Board display** — updates after every move, giving real-time feedback.
- **Win and tie detection** — friendly messages when a player wins or if there is a tie.
- **Replay option** — easily start a new game at the end of any match.

## How to Run

- Open `tic_tac_toe.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible Python environment.
- Run the cells step by step, or Run All.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to play!

## Learning Reflection

This project let me practice:
- Looping and conditional logic
- Modular code with functions
- User input handling and validation in Python
- Integrating separate code parts into a functioning, interactive program

**Challenges:**  
The most challenging part was integrating all of the individual functions together into one seamless, interactive game loop. I initially struggled to correctly alternate turns between players and ensure the game would end as soon as there was a win or a tie, instead of continuing to ask for more moves.

**How I Got There:**  
After hitting a few roadblocks, I sought help from AI (Comet) to diagnose my main game logic. With targeted feedback, I learned how to restructure my main loop, simplify player alternation, and use my own helper functions more effectively. This collaborative debugging experience taught me not only about code, but also about leveraging resources and asking good questions.
